# backgroundSelection
(shared repository for the background selection project)

## Hypothesis 1: The presence of background selection biases estimates of gamma, towards more negative values
please refer to the associated notebook for simulation set-ups and inference schemes: notebooks/bgs_bias_gamma.ipynb. 

## Hypothesis 2: Thresholding the SFS allows one to infer gamma more robustly (consistent up to a factor of B)

Hypothesis 2b: Inferring B and rescaling the estimates of gamma leads to useable inferences of 4Ns

## Hypothesis 3: Thresholding works even with varying population size
